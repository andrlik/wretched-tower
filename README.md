# Wretched Tower

A digital dice-based tool to use as an alternative to tumbling tower mechanics used in games, such as those based on the [Wretched and Alone SRD](https://sealedlibrary.itch.io/wretched-alone-srd) by Sealed Library.

## The mechanic

The idea for the mechanic was [originally posted](https://itch.io/jam/wretched-jam/topic/796498/dice-substitute-for-jenga-towers) by user Speak the Sky during a game jam for the SRD.

> Obviously a Jenga tower is a bit more specialised than dice or cards, and can't really been done easily and properly online, so here's a simple mechanic that uses d6s (and an online dice roller like orokos.com):
> 
> 1. 1st pull: roll 100(!)d6, take out the 1s,
> 2. 2nd pull: roll the dice you have left, take out the 1s etc.
> 3. 'lose' when you run out of dice.
>
> 100d6 is a lot, which is why you should do this digitally!
